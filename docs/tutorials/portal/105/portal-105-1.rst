----

**1. Execute an ADQL query for deep coadd images.**
Log in to the Portal Aspect, select the "DP1 & DP2 Images" tab and click on "Edit ADQL" at upper right.
Enter the following ADQL statement and click "Search" at lower left.
This query will return all processed visit images that overlap coordinates RA, Dec = 53.0, -28.0 degrees.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT dataproduct_type,dataproduct_subtype,calib_level,
           lsst_band,em_min,em_max,lsst_tract,lsst_patch,
           lsst_filter,lsst_visit,lsst_detector,t_exptime,
           t_min,t_max,s_ra,s_dec,s_fov,obs_id,obs_collection,
           o_ucd,facility_name,instrument_name,obs_title,
           s_region,access_url,access_format
  FROM ivoa.ObsCore
  WHERE obs_collection = 'LSST.DP2'
        AND dataproduct_subtype = 'lsst.deep_coadd'
        AND CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', 53.0, -28.0), s_region)=1


**2. Review the results interface for images.**
As shown in Figure 1, the default layout displays the selected image at upper left,
a default plot of RA vs. Dec at upper right, and the table with image metadata at the bottom.

    Figure 1: The results of the query above, which defaults to the screen split three ways: the selected image is in the upper left panel, a plot of RA, Dec positions of the images is shown in the upper right, and the bottom portion of the screen contains a table with information about the query results.


**3. Select a different image to display.**
Click on another row of the table so that it is highlighted in orange, and it will display at upper left.

**4. Subset images by filtering the table.**
In the table column for ``lsst_band``, use the drop-down table in the header (labeled "B" in Figure 1) to select only *r*-band images.
This will filter the table down to a single *r*-band image.

**5. Display multiple images.**
To display up to eight images side-by-side, clear the filter from step 4 so that all bands are showing, then click on the icon displaying six little boxes above the single image (labeled "A" in Figure 1). Sort the images in wavelength order (i.e., *ugrizy*) by clicking the ``em_min`` table header to sort on that column.

    Figure 2: The results of the query above, but displaying multiple images, corresponding to deep coadds in each of the six bands listed in the table.


**6. Hide the active chart (plot).**
Open the left sidebar using the menu icon at upper left.
Under "Results Layout," select a side-by-side view of the coverage/images panel and the tables panel, as in Figure 3.
The layout should now resemble Figure 4.
Note that it might be necessary to choose a different tab in the left panel in order to see the images instead of the coverage map or active chart.
