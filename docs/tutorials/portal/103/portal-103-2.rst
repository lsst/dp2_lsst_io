An introduction to ADQL
=======================

The `documentation for ADQL <http://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL>`_
includes more information about syntax, keywords, operators, functions, and so on.
ADQL is similar to SQL (Structured Query Langage).

A typical ADQL statement has at least three components:

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT <columns> FROM <catalog> WHERE <constraints>


where ``<columns>`` is a comma-separated list of the columns to return, ``<catalog>`` is the name of the catalog to retreive data from, and ``<constraints>`` imposes a restriction that only rows with column values that meet the constraints are returned.

For example, say there is a catalog called "mysurveydata" with 5 columns, "col1", "col2", and so on.
The following ADQL statement would return a table that has three columns, and as many rows as meet both of the restrictions in the ``WHERE`` statement.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT col3, col4, col5 FROM mysurveydata WHERE col1 > 0.5 AND col5 < 10


In the RSP Portal Aspect, ADQL queries are submitted to the TAP (Table Access Protocol) service.

----

**1. Go to the DP1 Catalogs ADQL interface.**
The button to switch from the user interface to the ADQL interface is in the upper right corner: "Edit ADQL".

**2. Review the ADQL interface.**
Browse the available tables in the TAP service in the left side-bar.
Scroll down to see examples of ADQL queries.
The interface should look like Figure 1.

**3. Enter the ADQL statement in the box.**
The following ADQL query selects the coordinates RA and Dec, and the *gri* PSF magnitudes for objects that are within a small circular region of the center of the ECDFS field (RA, Dec = 53, -28; radius = 0.05 degrees), and are brighter than 25th magnitude in all three filters.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT coord_ra, coord_dec, g_psfMag, r_psfMag, i_psfMag
  FROM dp1.Object
  WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec),
        CIRCLE('ICRS', 53, -28, 0.05))=1
  AND g_psfMag < 25 AND r_psfMag < 25 AND i_psfMag < 25


**4. Execute the ADQL query.**
Click the Search button at lower left.
The query will be executed and the 536 objects returned will be available in the results interface.
