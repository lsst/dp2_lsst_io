103.4. Join tables with ADQL
############################

For the Portal Aspect of the Rubin Science Platform at data.lsst.cloud.

**Data Release:** DP1

**Last verified to run:** 2025-06-28

**Learning objective:** Join multiple tables to retrieve combined results with ADQL.

**LSST data products:** ``Source``, ``Visit``, ``CcdVisit``, and ``Object`` tables

**Warning!**
Not all tables can be joined.
Two tables must have a column in common in order to be joined.

----

**1. Go to the DP1 Catalogs ADQL interface.**
Navigate to the Portal's DP1 Catalogs tab and switch to the ADQL interface by clicking "Edit ADQL".

**2. The ADQL components of a JOIN...ON statment.**
The generic example below illustrates a common join scenario.
Four columns ("ra", "dec", "colA", and "colB") are selected from "table1", for objects
where their coordinates are within 0.05 degrees of RA=62 deg, Dec=-37 deg.
The results from "table1" are joined with "table2" on their matching column, "colID".
Two columns are selected from "table2" ("colX" and "colY").

.. code-block:: SQL

   **This is a generic example - it cannot be executed.**

   SELECT tab1.ra, tab1.dec, tab1.colA, tab1.colB, tab2.colX, tab2.colY
   FROM table1 AS tab1
   JOIN table2 AS tab2
   ON tab1.colID = tab2.colID
   WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', tab1.ra, tab1.dec),
         CIRCLE('ICRS', 62.0, -37, 0.05)) = 1


**3. Execute a two-table join.**
The ``Source`` table (detections in individual processed visit images) can be joined with the
``CcdVisit`` table (metadata about individual visits) using a shared column, named ``Visit``
in the ``Source`` table and ``VisitId`` in the ``CcdVisit`` table,
which identifies an LSST visit.
Constraints can be applied on columns from either or both tables.
Spatial constraints are applied to the ``FROM`` table, not the ``JOIN`` table.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT src.coord_ra, src.coord_dec, src.sourceId, src.band,
         scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(src.psfFlux) AS psfAbMag,
         src.Visit, cv.VisitId,
         cv.expMidptMJD, cv.seeing
  FROM dp1.Source AS src
  JOIN dp1.CcdVisit AS cv
  ON src.Visit = cv.VisitId
  WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', src.coord_ra, src.coord_dec),
        CIRCLE('ICRS', 53.13, -28.10, 0.05)) = 1
        AND cv.expMidptMJD > 60631 AND cv.expMidptMJD < 60637
        AND src.band = 'i'

**4. Review the two-table join results.**
Notice that this join is not one-to-one: there are multiple individual sources returned that are matched to the same visit.
In other words, there are multiple rows from the ``Source`` table joined with a given row from the ``CcdVisit`` table.
If multiple tabs are present above the upper left panel in the default Results tab layout, click the "Coverage" tab to display the coverage chart.

**5. Execute a three-table join.**
The ``Object`` table (photometry in the deepCoadd images) can be joined with the
``ForcedSource`` table (photometry in individual processed visit images) using their shared ``objectId`` column.
The ``ForcedSource`` table can be joined with the ``CcdVisit`` table (metadata about individual visits) using a shared column, named ``Visit``
in the ``ForcedSource`` table and ``VisitId`` in the ``CcdVisit`` table,
which identifies an LSST visit.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT obj.coord_ra, obj.coord_dec, obj.objectId, obj.refExtendedness,
         scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(obj.i_psfFlux) AS obj_i_psfAbMag,
         scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(fs.psfFlux) AS fs_psfAbMag,
         cv.VisitId, cv.expMidptMJD, cv.seeing
  FROM dp1.Object AS obj
  JOIN dp1.ForcedSource AS fs
  ON obj.objectId = fs.objectId
  JOIN dp1.CcdVisit AS cv
  ON fs.Visit = cv.VisitId
  WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', obj.coord_ra, obj.coord_dec),
        CIRCLE('ICRS', 53.13, -28.10, 0.05)) = 1
        AND obj.refExtendedness = 1
        AND obj.i_psfFlux > 3600
        AND cv.expMidptMJD > 60631 AND cv.expMidptMJD < 60637
        AND fs.band = 'i'


**6. Review the three-table join results.**
The join of ``Object`` to ``ForcedSource`` is one-to-many, and the join of ``ForcedSource`` to ``CcdVisit`` is many-to-one.
To view the coverage chart, click the "Coverage" tab at the top of the upper left panel.
