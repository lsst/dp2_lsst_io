----

**1. Log in to the Portal and execute a query.**
Go to the Portal's DP1 & DP2 Catalogs tab, switch to the ADQL interface, and execute the query below.
This query returns coordinates and magnitudes for objects near the center of the ECDFS field
that are brighter than 22 mag in *g* and *r*.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT coord_dec, coord_ra, g_cModelMag, r_cModelMag
  FROM dp2.Object
  WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec),
        CIRCLE('ICRS', 53.0, -28.0, 1.0)) =1
        AND g_cModelMag < 22 AND r_cModelMag < 22


**2. View the default active chart in the results interface**.
It should appear similar to Figure 1.
If many more rows are returned, the default plot will automatically switch from scatter plot (as in Figure 1) to a 2D histogram (heatmap).

**3. Open the "Add New Chart" window.**
Click on the plus sign in the circle (L in Figure 1).
The "Add New Chart" pop-up window will appear.

**4. Select columns for the X and Y axes.**
In this example, for a color-magnitude diagram, set the X to ``g_cModelMag - r_cModelMag`` and the Y to ``r_cModelMag``.
Click OK.

**5. Customize the symbol color.**
Click on the newly added plot so that it has a light orange box around it, indicating it is selected.
Click on the "Settings" icon to open the "Plot Parameters" pop-up window (the gear symbol; J in Figure 1).
Under "Trace Options", next to "Color", click the magnifying glass to open the color picker and choose a point color, as in Figure 3.

**6. Change the plot title and axes.**
Under "Chart Options", set the title and X and Y labels, choose to reverse the Y axis, and set the X minimum and maximum values as in Figure 4.
Then click "Apply" and close the pop-up window.

**7. View the customizations.**
The newly added chart is now customized, as in Figure 5.
