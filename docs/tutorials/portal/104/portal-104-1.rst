----

**1. Log in to the Portal Aspect of the RSP.**
Log in to the Portal, click on the "DP1 & DP2 Catalogs" tab, and switch to the ADQL interface.

**2. Execute a query.**
Enter the query below into the ADQL box, and click "Search".
This query returns coordinates and magnitudes for objects near the center of the ECDFS field that are brighter than 22 mag in *g* and *r*.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT coord_dec, coord_ra, g_cModelMag, r_cModelMag
  FROM dp2.Object
  WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec),
        CIRCLE('ICRS', 53.0, -28.0, 1.0)) =1
        AND g_cModelMag < 22 AND r_cModelMag < 22


**3. View the results interface.**
The default layout of the results interface is shown in Figure 1.

.. figure:: images/portal-104-1-1.png
    :name: portal-104-1-1
    :alt: The results interface.

    Figure 1: The results interface after a query has been executed defaults to a screen split three ways: the coverage map (A), the active chart (B), and the table (C).


**3.1. Coverage chart.**
The coverage chart's default location is upper left; A in Figure 1.
The default view is a `HEALPix <https://healpix.sourceforge.io/>`_ grid showing the number of returned objects per grid region.
If few objects are returned by a query, or if the zoom-in function is used, instead of a grid small colored squares will mark individual objects.
The background is the DP2 *gri* pretty color coadd (HiPS map).

**3.2. Active chart.**
The active chart's default location is upper right; B in Figure 1.
The default plot will be the first two columns of the returned data table.
In Figure 1, this is RA vs. Dec.
This default plot will be a two-dimensional histogram if so many objects are returned that individual points cannot be distinguished.

**3.3. Table.**
The table's default location is along the bottom; C in Figure 1.
A scrollable, filterable table of the returned data, with the first row selected by default and shown in orange.
Note that the orange point in the active chart corresponds to the selected row.


**4. View layout options.**
At upper left, click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) to open the sidebar menu.
Under "Results Layout", click on the icon of the default layout ("up-down" arrows, or "D" in Figure 2) to see all layout options.
Note that the "Results Layout" box appears in the sidebar only after a "search" has been executed.

**5. Change the layout.**
In the sidebar menu in Figure 2, choose the two-panel view of coverage charts on the left and tables on the right.
Notice that the active chart (the plot) is still available as a tab at upper left.
Reopen the sidebar menu to try other layouts and return to the default three-panel view.

**6. Execute a different query.**
Click on the tab "DP1 & DP2 Catalogs" to return to the ADQL interface.
Change the query to return fainter objects in a smaller region, using the ADQL below.
Execute the query.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT coord_dec, coord_ra, g_cModelMag, r_cModelMag
  FROM dp2.Object
  WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec),
        CIRCLE('ICRS', 53.0, -28.0, 0.2)) =1
        AND g_cModelMag < 25 AND r_cModelMag < 25


**7. View multiple query results.**
The results interface is now populated with data from the new query (Figure 3).
The table (C in Figure 3) now has two tabs, one for the old query (red) and one for the new (cyan).
The coverage chart (A in Figure 3) includes a grid for both queries, in colors that match the table.
The active chart (B in Figure 3) is the default plot for the new query, because it is the selected table.
The unwanted query results can be deleted by clicking "X" in the corresponding tab above the table.

**7. Switch between multiple query results.**
Click on the tab for the first query and note that the coverage chart, table, and active chart change.

**8. Delete unwanted query results.**
In the table, click on the X in the tab for the first query results (the leftmost one) to delete them.
