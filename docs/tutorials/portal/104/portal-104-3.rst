----

**1. Log in to the Portal and execute a query.**
Go to the Portal's DP1 & DP2 Catalogs tab, switch to the ADQL interface, and execute the query below.
This query returns coordinates and magnitudes for objects near the center of the ECDFS field
that are brighter than 22 mag in *g* and *r*.

.. code-block:: SQL

  SELECT coord_dec, coord_ra, g_cModelMag, r_cModelMag
  FROM dp2.Object
  WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec),
        CIRCLE('ICRS', 53.0, -28.0, 1.0)) =1
        AND g_cModelMag < 22 AND r_cModelMag < 22


**2. View the table in the results interface**.
It should appear similar to Figure 1.

**3. Mouse-over for pop-up notes.**
In the table panel (Figure 1) use the mouse to hover over the column headers and icons to see pop-up explanations.

**4. Explore menus and icons.**
In the table panel (Figure 1) click on each of the items below and review the functionality.

* A: **Table length** - number of rows returned.
* B: **Filter** - show only selected rows.
* C: **Navigate** the pages of the table or jump to a page.
* D: **Actions** - generate new TAP searches (advanced, not covered in this tutorial).
* E: **Column filters** - show or hide the header row for table filter entries.
* F: **Text view** - switch the table view to text mode.
* G: **Save** file (download table); a variety of formats are offered.
* H: **Add a column** that is derived from existing columns.
* I: **Information** about the query job that produced these results.
* J: **Table options** - open a pop-up window to show, hide, or filter columns.
* K: **Expand panel** - have the table take the full browser window.

**5. Sort the table.**
Click on the table header ``coord_ra`` to sort the table by the Right Ascension coordinate.
Any column can be sorted in this way.

**6. Select rows and use the filter.**
Select the first 10 rows after sorting by RA, then click the funnel (B in Figure 1).
The coverage map and the active chart will also update to display only data from the selected rows, as in Figure 2.

**7. Remove the filter and selection.**
Click the "unfilter" icon at upper right in the table panel to remove the filter (A in Figure 2).
Click the "unselect" icon at upper right in the active chart panel to unselect all objects (B in Figure 2).

**8. Add a column to the table.**
Select the "Add a column" icon (H in Figure 1).
In the pop-up window, enter a name for the new column (e.g., ``gr_color``) and the expression to derive it from existing columns (e.g., ``g_cModelMag - r_cModelMag``), then click "Add Column".
The new column appears at the right-hand side of the table, as shown in Figure 3.
