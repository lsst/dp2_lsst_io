**1. Log in to the Portal aspect of the Rubin Science Platform and execute a query.** Go to the Portal’s "DP1 & DP2 Catalogs" tab. Switch to the ADQL interface. Copy-paste the query below into the box, which will retrieve g- and r-band magnitudes for a sample of extended objects (galaxies) with fluxes greater than 360 nJy. Click “Search”.

.. code-block:: SQL

   SELECT coord_dec, coord_ra,
   g_cModelMag,
   r_cModelMag,
   g_extendedness,
   r_extendedness
   FROM dp2.Object
   WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec),
   CIRCLE('ICRS', 53.0, -28.0, 0.3)) =1
   AND g_extendedness = 1
   AND r_extendedness = 1
   AND g_cModelFlux > 360
   AND r_cModelFlux > 360

**2. Add a new chart, and choose histogram.**
The default plot in "Active Charts" panel shows the number of objects as a function of position in the selected region.
In the Active Chart panel, click on the "+" button in the upper-left corner of the panel.
In the "Add New Chart" pop-up window select "Histogram" as the plot type and enter ``g_cModelMag`` as the column (Figure 1).
Click "OK".

**3. Delete the default chart.**
Remove the default plot of ``coord_ra`` vs. ``coord_dec`` by clicking on the "x" in the upper right corner of the plot.

**4. Add a new chart, and choose heatmap.**
Open the "Add New Chart" pop-up window.
Select "Heatmap" as the plot type and enter ``g_cModelMag`` for X and the expression ``g_cModelMag`` - ``r_cModelMag`` for Y (Figure 2).
Leave the Color Scale as "Default".
Click "OK".
