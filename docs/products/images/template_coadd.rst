Template coadd
##############

The combination of processed images with the best seeing, for a patch of sky and for each of the six LSST filters, to be used as a template for difference imaging.

Access
======

The template coadd images are accessible via the Butler, SIA, and TAP services.

Butler
------

* `Dataset type <products_butler_terminology>`\ : ('template_coadd', {**band**, **skymap**, **tract**, **patch**}, ExposureF)
* Format: FITS
* Number of Butler datasets: |template_coadd_butler_count|

SIA and TAP
-----------

Schema: `ObsCore table <https://sdm-schemas.lsst.io/ivoa_obscore.html>`_

IVOA calibration level: 3

Dataproduct subtype: ``lsst.template_coadd``


Description
===========

For DP1 the one-third of all visit images with the best seeing were
used as input images (or the best 12, if there were fewer than 36 images total).
A mean stacking algorithm, weighted by inverse variance, combines selected exposures.

Each individual template coadd image covers a single patch of the sky:
a quadrilateral sub-region of the overall skymap that covers approximately 128 square arcminutes.
Patches slightly overlap at their edges.
Template coadd images are for a single filter.

Processing
----------

The template coadd images are the result of :doc:`/processing/coaddition/index`,
and they are used in :doc:`/processing/dia/index`.

Pixel data
----------

The template coadd images have three planes of pixel data.

Image: sky pixel data in flux units of nJy.

Variance: uncertainty (noise) in the flux in units of nJy^2.

Mask: an integer bitmask of representative flag values that indicate processing status or issues,
similar to the `SDSS bitmasks <https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/algorithms/bitmasks/>`_.


Metadata
--------

The metadata for template coadd images retrieved from the Butler include a list of the input visit images,
and the derived PSF, photometric calibration, and WCS.

WCS
"""

The World Coordinate System objects for coadd images are exactly representable as FITS (they are simple TAN projections), but each ``tract`` has its own WCS that is shared by all ``patches``, with an integer offset that must be applied for each patch manually to index the pixel arrays.

See `products_wcs_known_issues` for more information.
