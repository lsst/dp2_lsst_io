Deep and Template Coadd Mask Planes
===================================

This page documents the mask planes used in deep coadd and template coadd images.
Each plane corresponds to a bit in the coadd mask and reflects the propagation or summary of pixel conditions from contributing single-visit exposures.

``BAD``
    Pixel is flagged as bad in one or more input exposures.
    The ``BAD`` flag is set if all contributing inputs had the pixel marked bad or if the coadd inherited a bad status for that location.
    Typically, ``BAD`` pixels on the coadd correspond to known defects where no usable inputs remained.
    These often appear alongside ``NO_DATA`` in deeply masked regions.

``CLIPPED``
    Pixel was excluded during coaddition due to artifact clipping -- i.e. at least one input image for this pixel was identified as an artifact and excluded.
    The coaddition algorithm aggressively rejects transient features such as cosmic rays, meteors, or satellite trails.

``CR``
    One or more input visits flagged this pixel as a cosmic ray.
    That input’s contribution is rejected, but other clean exposures may still contribute.
    ``CR`` indicates cosmic ray activity in the input stack at this location.

``CROSSTALK``
    At least one input exposure marked this pixel as affected by crosstalk.
    As with ``CR``, other clean visits may contribute.
    ``CROSSTALK`` serves as a provenance indicator for masked artifacts.

``DETECTED``
    Pixel was detected as part of a source footprint on the coadd itself.
    This is set after coaddition when sources are measured on the final stacked image.
    All pixels in detected footprints are flagged ``DETECTED``.

``DETECTED_NEGATIVE``
    Used in :ref:`difference images <images-difference-image>` only, see the :ref:`visit and difference image <images-visit-mask-planes>` page.

``EDGE``
    Pixel lies near the nominal edge of an input image.
    In practice, coadds use ``SENSOR_EDGE`` for meaningful edge marking.
    The ``EDGE`` bit is retained for compatibility but less relevant than in visit images.

``INEXACT_PSF``
    The PSF at this pixel is ill-defined or varies significantly across inputs.
    This usually occurs at patch boundaries or regions with partial input coverage.
    When set, ``INEXACT_PSF`` is always accompanied by at least one of ``SENSOR_EDGE``, ``CLIPPED``, or ``REJECTED`` flags.

``INTRP``
    Pixel value was interpolated during stacking, or all inputs had this pixel marked interpolated.
    If only interpolated pixels contributed at this location, the coadd propagates ``INTRP``.
    This is rare in coadds but possible in narrow masked regions.

``ITL_DIP``
    One or more input images flagged this pixel as affected by the ITL “dip” artifact.
    This dark trail appears on some ITL CCDs due to bright stars.
    ``ITL_DIP`` in coadds marks locations where dips were flagged in the visit images and may help interpret masked vertical artifacts.

``NOT_DEBLENDED``
    A source footprint on the coadd could not be deblended.
    Large or complex detections, such as stellar halos or crowded galaxies, may skip deblending.
    The entire footprint receives the ``NOT_DEBLENDED`` mask.

``NO_DATA``
    No usable data contributed to this coadd pixel.
    ``NO_DATA`` is common at tract patch edges or in areas not covered by any visit.
    It may also occur where inputs were masked and no valid interpolation was possible.

``REJECTED``
    Pixel where a contributing image was masked and not used.
    On coadds, this flags pixels where one or more input exposures had the pixel masked (e.g. ``BAD`` or ``SAT``) and thus that pixel’s coadd value comes from fewer images.
    Many ``REJECTED`` pixels are those falling on a sensor defect or bad column that persisted through single-frame processing.
    If all inputs rejected this pixel, it may be flagged as ``REJECTED`` and possibly ``NO_DATA``.

``SAT``
    One or more input images had this pixel flagged ``SAT`` (saturated).
    If a configurable fraction of contributing visits flagged it as saturated, the coadd sets ``SAT``.
    This does not mean the coadd pixel itself is saturated, but that saturation affected at least part of the stack at this location.

``SENSOR_EDGE``
    Pixel lies within a margin near the edge of at least one contributing input image.
    This margin is set during warping and coaddition and flags partial or unreliable coverage.
    Objects with pixels in ``SENSOR_EDGE`` regions may have poor PSF modeling or incomplete photometry.

``STREAK``
    Used in :ref:`difference images <images-difference-image>` only, see the :ref:`visit and difference image <images-visit-mask-planes>` page.

``SUSPECT``
    Pixel was flagged as ``SUSPECT`` (likely above the PTC turnoff but not fully saturated) in one or more inputs.
    If a configurable fraction of input visits marked the pixel as ``SUSPECT``, it propagates to the coadd.
    Unlike ``SAT``, ``SUSPECT`` is not dilated, and thus this bit marks only the directly affected pixels.
    It indicates that photometry may be mildly biased due to non-linearity or blooming shoulders.

``UNMASKEDNAN``
    Coadd pixel contains a NaN due to all contributing inputs being invalid or some processing error.
    This is rare and usually indicates a failure to interpolate or combine values properly.
    The ``UNMASKEDNAN`` bit serves as a safety net for unexpected invalid results.

``VIGNETTED``
    Pixel lies in a vignetted region in all contributing visits.
    These areas received significantly less flux due to optical shading near the corners or edge of the field.
    ``VIGNETTED`` pixels may appear at the outer edges of the coadd and usually have lower weight.
