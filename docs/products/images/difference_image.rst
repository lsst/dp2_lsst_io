Description
===========

Difference images are created by taking template coadd images, then
resizing, warping, PSF-matching, and scaling them to a given visit image,
and subtracting the result from the visit image.
Each individual difference image contains data from one of the camera's detectors.

Difference images contain sources of residual flux from the subtraction, both
positive and negative.
Real astrophyisical transients, variables, and moving objects appear as sources with
a flux that is equal to the difference between their flux in the template and visit images.

For *future* data releases, to save space, the difference images will not be stored.
Instead, a tool for on-the-fly difference image recreation will be provided to users.

For DP1, the difference images are served and can be retrieved
and displayed by users instantaneously, but the inputs and tools
for their re-creation are not supplied.

Processing
----------

The difference images are the result of :doc:`/processing/dia/index`.

Pixel data
----------

The difference images have three planes of pixel data.

Image: sky pixel data in flux units of nJy.

Variance: uncertainty (noise) in the flux in units of nJy^2.

Mask: an integer bitmask of representative flag values that indicate processing status or issues,
similar to the `SDSS bitmasks <https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/algorithms/bitmasks/>`_.


Metadata
--------

The metadata for difference images retrieved from the Butler include
information about the observation (e.g., pointing, weather),
and the derived PSF, photometric calibration, and WCS.

WCS
"""

The World Coordinate System objects for difference images are not exactly representable as FITS; the FITS headers have an approximation that is good enough only for visualization.
Transformations with the true WCS are currently only possible using LSST Science Pipelines libraries, and those can be easy to misuse.
See :ref:`products_wcs_known_issues` for more information.
