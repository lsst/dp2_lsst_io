Tables of measurements made on sources and objects detected in the processed images,
and tables of survey metadata for the observations.

The `schema browser <https://sdm-schemas.lsst.io/>`_ includes column descriptions for all tables.

Catalog data products are available via TAP, and most are also available with the Butler.
See the :doc:`/access/index` and the :doc:`/tutorials/index` pages to get started with these services.
