Description
===========

A "source" is a signal-to-noise ratio > 5 detection in a visit image.

The source catalog contains measurements on a visit image
at the coordinates of every source detected in that image.

Measurements include PSF and Gaussian fluxes and sizes,
as well as processing pixel flags.

Processing
----------

The source catalog is the result of :doc:`/processing/detection/index`.

Tutorials
---------

See the :ref:`200-level notebook <notebook-200>` or :ref:`200-level portal <portal-200>`
tutorials demonstrating how to access the source table.
