Description
===========

A "DIA source" is a signal-to-noise ratio > 5 detection in a difference image.

The DIA source table contains measurements on a difference image at the coordinates of every source detected in that difference image.
These measurements include PSF-fit and forced PSF fluxes, and aperture and trailed-source fluxes.
Forced PSF fluxes on the corresponding visit (i.e., "direct" or "science") image at the coordinates of the DIA source are also included.

Processing
----------

The DIA source table is the result of :doc:`/processing/dia/index`.

Tutorials
---------

See the 200-level catalog :doc:`/tutorials/index` for a notebook on the DIA source table.
