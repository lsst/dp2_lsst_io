Measurements for sources detected in difference images.

Access
======

The DIA source catalog is accessible via the TAP and Butler services.

**Recommended access service:** TAP

DIA sources are sharded by ``tract``, not ``visit`` in order to make them easier to join to their `catalogs-dia-object`.

Description
===========

A "DIA source" is a signal-to-noise ratio > 5 detection in a difference image.

The DIA source catalog contains measurements on a difference image
at the coordinates of every source detected in that difference image.
These measurements include PSF-fit and forced PSF fluxes, and aperture and
trailed-source fluxes.
Forced PSF fluxes on the corresponding visit (i.e., "direct" or "science") image
at the coordinates of the DIA source are also included.


Processing

The DIA source catalog is the result of :doc:`/processing/dia/index`.
